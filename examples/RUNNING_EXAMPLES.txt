To run lua examples you will need to copy:

  pollnet.lua
  pollnet.[dll | so | dylib]

into this directory, and you'll need to have LuaJIT.
(Either install luajit globally, 
 or copy luajit.exe + lua51.dll into this folder)

Then you can run for example:
  luajit httpget.lua https://www.example.com
